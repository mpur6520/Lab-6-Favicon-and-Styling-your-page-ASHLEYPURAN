      <p style="color: purple; background-color: lavenderblush;"> A favicon is a small icon that essentially serves as an image for your website; it's used to represent a webpage and is the tiny photo next to the title. It's an icon that correlates to your webpage and can be seen in areas such as the page's tab, bookmarks, and various other areas. Favicons are created using pixels and are then put into place with the "link" command, which allows you to input the "rel", "type" and "href" attributes; these attributes help put your icon into place. The way that I created my favicon was first using google sheets to create a pixelated design, then screenshotting that and creating a smaller version using a third-party website, called "photopea". I used the smaller version of my favicon and followed the steps I described earlier, which resulted in the image being displayed on the tab. </p>
